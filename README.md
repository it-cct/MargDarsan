# What is java programming?
Java is a popular programming language which is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games and much more.Despite having been invented over 20 years ago, Java is currently the most popular programming language for app developers.Java is a multiplatform, object-oriented programming language that runs on billions of devices worldwide.

# Why java is considered good?
Java is comsidered good among the programminmg languages due to the following reasons:
## 1. object-oriented
-> Java is a pure object oriented program,ming language as all it's programs are written in class which have its own attributes and methods to help in doing various tasks.

## 2. JVM & cross-platform compatibility
Another reason why the Java programming language is so popular is the fact that JVM- Java Virtual Machine allows applications coded in Java to be supported by platforms like Mac OS, Windows, and Unix.

## 3. library classes and methods
-> Java have thousands of in built classes which holds thousands of methods inside it to help in performing various of tasks during the program.

## 4. Stable language
The Java programming language is constantly evolving. It has grown manifolds since its introduction in the early 90s. Java software development services are constantly rising and it has not reached maturity yet.

## 5. Diverse libraries
Java offers a wide variety of libraries to solve the most mundane problems with ease. Most of the libraries are open-source, free, and offer an enterprise-friendly license. It enables you to secure your coding without having to start from scratch.

## 6. High speed and performance
In any business, applications depend on performance and speed. This need in finding an ideal solution to match the real-time pace is met by Java very well. The technology of Java applications uses multi-threading which reduces memory consumption during its actions.

## 7. Secure applications
Another reason why the Java programming language is so popular is the wide array of security features that it’s providing.

## 8. Scalable infrastructure and reliability
Java is competent to manage enterprise-scale workloads and serves as an all-around universal solution. Libraries are a basic functional unit of any industrial operation. Java provides extensive libraries making it an ideal choice for companies and has a scalable infrastructure along with the additional features of proven tools, libraries, and frameworks to cater to any requirements by the company.

## 9. Low maintenance cost
Last but not least, the reason for the popularity of Java as a programming language, is because it doesn’t require much of a budget to set up and maintain a Java server. Java comes with no licensing cost, making it time efficient and relieving. The programming language is compatible with multiple hardware devices.

# History of java
Java is an Object-Oriented programming language developed by James Gosling in the early 1990s.The team initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, television, etc. Originally C++ was considered to be used in the project but the idea was rejected for several reasons(For instance C++ required more memory). Gosling endeavoured to alter and expand C++ however before long surrendered that for making another stage called Green. James Gosling and his team called their project “Greentalk” and its file extension was .gt and later became to known as “OAK”

# Requirements of java
As a development tool, java needs have some requirements to run java applications in the developing device.

Java needs a jdk file to be installed and implemented in the device toget access to the in-built classes with their methods.

# Sample program to show "Hello-World"
1. package abc
2. Class Main
3. {
4. System.Out.println("Hello-World")
5. }
